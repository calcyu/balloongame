# 打气球游戏简介🎈🎈

想教6岁的儿子学编程，但打字速度太慢，必须快速把打字速度练上去。我是在初中接触电脑的，当时只会玩游戏，比如红警，帝国时代，编队`shift+1 ctrl+1`，真正会打字是在高中机房玩打字游戏。知道打字游戏能高效的提高打字速度，故编写了这个打字游戏，有同样需求的家长，可以直接拿去玩！共勉🎈🎈。

# Introduction to the Balloon Game 🎈🎈

I want to teach my 6-year-old son to program, but his typing speed is too slow, so I must practice typing speed quickly. I came into contact with computers in junior high school. At that time, I could only play games, such as Red Alarm, Age of Empires, and 'shift+1 ctrl+1' in formation. I really knew how to type when I played typing games in the computer room of senior high school. Know the typing game can efficiently improve the typing speed, so the preparation of the typing game, have the same needs of parents, can directly take to play! Encourage you to 🎈🎈.
